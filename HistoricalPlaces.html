            <p>The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

            Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.
            
            The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being “the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world’s heritage”. It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India’s rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7–8 million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007) initiative. </p></div>

        <div id="paragraph2"><p>Amer Fort (Hindi: अमेर किला) also known as Amber fort is a Fort situated in Amer, Rajasthan, India. Amer is a town with a location of 4 square kilometers (1.5 sq mi) located 11 kilometers (6.8 mi) from Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. Located high up on a hill, it is the tourist attraction destination in Jaipur. The town of Amer was originally built by Meenas, and later it was ruled by Raja Man Singh (December 21, 1550– July 6, 1614). Amer Fort is known for its imaginative Hindu design elements. With its large ramparts and collection of gates and cobbled paths, the Fort overlooks Maota Lake, which is the major source of water for the Amer Palace.

            Constructed of red sandstone and marble, the appealing, luxurious place is laid out on 4 levels, each with a courtyard. It consists of the Diwan-i-Aam, or “Hall of Public Audience”, the Diwan-i-Khas, or “Hall of Private Audience”, the Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), or Jai Mandir, and also the Sukh Niwas where a trendy environment is synthetically produced by winds that blow over a water waterfall within the royal palace.

        <div id="paragraph3"><p>The Red Fort Complex was built as the palace fort of Shahjahanabad – the new capital of the fifth Mughal Emperor of India, Shah Jahan. Named for its massive enclosing walls of red sandstone, it is adjacent to an older fort, the Salimgarh, built by Islam Shah Suri in 1546, with which it forms the Red Fort Complex. The private apartments consist of a row of pavilions connected by a continuous water channel, known as the Nahr-i-Behisht (Stream of Paradise). The Red Fort is considered to represent the zenith of Mughal creativity which, under the Shah Jahan, was brought to a new level of refinement. The planning of the palace is based on Islamic prototypes, but each pavilion reveals architectural elements typical of Mughal building, reflecting a fusion of Persian, Timurid and Hindu traditions The Red Fort’s innovative planning and architectural style, including the garden design, strongly influenced later buildings and gardens in Rajasthan, Delhi, Agra and further afield.</p></div>

        <div id ="paragraph4"><p>Great Stupa, most noteworthy of the structures at the historic site of Sanchi in Madhya Pradesh state, India. It is one of the oldest Buddhist monuments in the country and the largest stupa at the site.

            The Great Stupa (also called stupa no. 1) was originally built in the 3rd century BCE by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka and is believed to house ashes of the Buddha. The simple structure was damaged at some point during the 2nd century BCE. It was later repaired and enlarged, and elements were added; it reached its final form in the 1st century BCE. The building is 120 feet (37 metres) wide and 54 feet (17 metres) high.
            The most noteworthy of the structures is the Great Stupa (stupa no. 1), discovered in 1818. It was probably begun by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka in the mid-3rd century BCE and later enlarged. Solid throughout, it is enclosed by a massive stone railing pierced by four gateways, which are adorned with elaborate carvings (known as Sanchi sculpture) depicting the life of the Buddha, legends of his previous births, and other scenes important to early Buddhism (notably Ashoka’s visit to the Bo tree in Bodh Gaya). The stupa itself consists of a base bearing a hemispherical dome (anda), symbolizing the dome of heaven enclosing the earth. It is surmounted by a squared rail unit (harmika) representing the world mountain, from which rises a mast (yashti), symbolizing the cosmic axis. The mast bears umbrellas (chatras) that represent the various heavens (devaloka).</p></div>

            <div id="paragraph5"><p>Mysore Palace, also called Mysuru Palace, or Amba Vilas, a sprawling three-story, gray granite, Indo-Saracenic building capped by a five-story tower that culminates in a gilded dome in the southern Indian city of Mysuru in Karnataka state. The city is home to a number of palaces, but when people talk of Mysore Palace, they are referring to this palace within a historic fort. Also referred to as the Amba Vilas. the site features cows grazing happily among the lush gardens and twelve Hindu temples that also make up the complex. The site’s history is closely linked to that of the royal family of the former kingdom of Mysore, the Wadiyar dynasty. The family ruled the area from 1399, when they first lived in a palace at Mysore, and the city became the kingdom’s capital in 1799.
                The Mysore Palace is now a museum and major tourist attraction. Highlights include many ornate rooms and the colonnaded Durbar Hall. In addition, every fall the Dussehra festival is celebrated at the palace.

                <div id="paragraph 7"><P>Built in the early 13th century a few kilometres south of Delhi, the red sandstone tower of Qutb Minar is 72.5 m high, tapering from 2.75 m in diameter at its peak to 14.32 m at its base, and alternating angular and rounded flutings. The surrounding archaeological area contains funerary buildings, notably the magnificent Alai-Darwaza Gate, the masterpiece of Indo-Muslim art (built in 1311), and two mosques, including the Quwwatu'l-Islam, the oldest in northern India, built of materials reused from some 20 Brahman temples.
                    e 13th-century square tomb of Iltutmish in the north-western part of Quwwatu’l-Islam marks the beginning of the tradition of constructing royal tombs, a practice followed as late as the Mughal era in India. The tomb-chamber is profusely carved with inscriptions and geometrical and arabesque patterns associated with Saracenic tradition. Expansions made by Allaudin Khilji to the existing ensemble between 1296 and 1311 reflect the power wielded by the monarch. In his short reign, the emperor added a massive ceremonial gateway (Alai Darwaza) south of the Qutb Minar, and also added a madarsa (place of learning). The first storey of the incomplete Alai Minar, which was envisaged to be twice the scale of the Qutb Minar, stands 25 metres high.

            <div id="paragraph 8"><p>
                Hawa Mahal, one of the best places to visit in Jaipur, features a splendid fusion of Islamic, Mughal, and Rajput architectural styles. Its domed canopies, floral patterns, lotus motifs, and fluted pillars, all reflect the rich Rajput style. Complementing these elements is the filigree work in stone and lavish arches, both of which draw influence from the Islamic style of architecture.
                
                Designed in red and pink sandstone, this one-of-its-kind palace boasts of a pyramidal shape. It has five stories and rises up to a height of 50 feet. The 953 windows featured on the front part of the palace lend it a honeycombed hive look. Thanks to the exceptional latticework on these windows, the palace experiences a cooling effect as the breeze blows in through them. Delicately designed hanging cornices are another attractive aspect of Hawa Mahal’s architecture.
                
                The interiors of the palace consist of pillared chambers and minimally ornamented corridors that reach up to the top floor. Patios adorn the front part of the first and second floors. Unlike the lower two floors, the top three floors have a width that’s not more than a single room.  There are fountains adorning the center of the building’s courtyard. </p></div>

                <div id="paragraph 9"><p>The Golden temple is located in the holy city of the Sikhs, Amritsar. The Golden temple is famous for its full golden dome, it is one of the most sacred pilgrim spots for Sikhs. The Mandir is built on a 67-ft square of marble and is a two storied structure. Maharaja Ranjit Singh had the upper half of the building built with approximately 400 kg of gold leaf. The Golden Temple is surrounded by a number of other famous temples like the Durgiana Temple. The fourth Guru of Sikhs, Guru Ram Das, who had initially constructed a pool here, founded Amritsar, which houses the Golden Temple or Harmandir Sahib. It is here that Sage Valmiki wrote the epic, Ramayana. Rama and Sita are believed to have spent their fourteen-year exile in Amritsar, the epicenter of Sikhism. To the south of the temple is a garden, and the tower of Baba Atal. The Central Sikh Museum is atop the Clock Tower. The ‘Guru Ka Langar’ offers free food to around 20,000 people everyday. The number shoots up to 100,000 on special occasions. A visitor must cover his / her head before entering the temple premises. The Granth Sahib is kept in the Temple during the day and is kept in the Akal Takht or Eternal Throne in the night. The Akal Takht also houses the ancient weapons used by the Sikh warriors. Guru Hargobind established it. The rugged old Jubi Tree in the north west corner of the compound is believed to possess special powers. It was planted 450 years ago, by the Golden Temple’s first high priest, Baba Buddha. Guru-ka-Langar or the communal canteen is towards the eastern entrance of the temple complex, and it provides free food to all visitors, regardless of colour, creed, caste or gender. Visitors to the Golden Temple must remove their shoes and cover their heads before entering the temple. The temple is less crowded in the early mornings on weekends.</p></div>
